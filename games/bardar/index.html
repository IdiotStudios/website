        <small>(New Year Update)</small>
        <p>Happy Belated New Year! BarDar continues to evolve with exciting new features and improvements.</p>
        <p>As you can probably see, we have updated our games page and made this new one. This will provide a way easier experience!</p>
        <p>Since our last update, we have doubled the size for everything in our game to allow better quality assets and visuals. We are also in the works of adding audio to the game.</p>
        <p>We have updated its vision system and done a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
        <p>Next we will work on a tutorial for the game and will add a changelog to this website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks for reading, will keep you updated!</p>

        <small>(Demo in 2026)</small>
        <p>BarDar has had many improvements so far and a bunch of work has been done. We are almost ready to release a demo for it, however we are working on a tutorial ingame first.</p>
        <p>If anyone even reads this, then they may notice the games logo has updated, this is because I managed to get someone to do the art for the game. Its way better now.</p>
        <p>Will keep this page updated but we might migrate to a proper devlog system later on.</p>
